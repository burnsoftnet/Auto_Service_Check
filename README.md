# Auto_Service_Check
This VBScript will check all the Automatic Services on a windows machine and restart them if they are not up and running. The script has the ability to check the local machine or a remote machine. This is task that we normally run on Task Scheduler using the AutoServe.bat this is included in the project. Since the script runs on itâ€™s own interval we normally set the Task Scheduler Task to run on system start. If you look in the Batch Script we have the vbscript pipe the output to a log file, with in the batch script there is a function to check the log size, if it is over 700KB then delete before running the script, the way we have task scheduler setup, a new log will be created on the next restart, only if it is over 700KB.
